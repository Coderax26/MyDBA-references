Understood. If GoldenGate itself is not in your control, the only practical way is to prove from the database side that Replicat is being slowed by DB conditions. Below is a DBA focused, evidence driven checklist you can run on the target database while lag is increasing.

I am keeping this strictly database side.

⸻

1. First confirm Replicat is actively applying and not idle

GoldenGate Replicat sessions connect as DB sessions. Identify them.

select sid, serial#, username, program, module, status
from v$session
where program like '%ggs%';

If:
	•	STATUS = ACTIVE but lag increases → DB side bottleneck
	•	STATUS = INACTIVE → Replicat is waiting on GG side, DB is not the issue

⸻

2. Check what Replicat sessions are waiting on

This is the most important query.

select sid,
       event,
       wait_class,
       seconds_in_wait,
       state
from v$session
where sid in (
  select sid from v$session where program like '%ggs%'
);

Interpret results

Event	Meaning
log file sync	Commit pressure
enq: TX - row lock contention	Blocking by another session
buffer busy waits	Hot blocks
db file sequential read	Index lookup slow
db file scattered read	Full scans
free buffer waits	DBWR slow
resmgr:cpu quantum	CPU throttling
latch: cache buffers chains	Hot block or index

If you see TX locks or buffer busy, DB is 100% the cause.

3. Identify blockers blocking Replicat

Very common and often missed.

select
  s1.sid blocked_sid,
  s2.sid blocker_sid,
  s2.username blocker_user,
  s2.program blocker_program
from v$lock l1
join v$session s1 on s1.sid = l1.sid
join v$lock l2 on l1.id1 = l2.id1 and l1.id2 = l2.id2
join v$session s2 on s2.sid = l2.sid
where l1.request > 0
and l2.lmode > 0
and s1.program like '%ggs%';

If Replicat is blocked:
	•	By batch job
	•	By reporting queries
	•	By another Replicat

You now have hard proof.

⸻

4. Check commit pressure

GoldenGate commits very frequently.

select name, value
from v$sysstat
where name in (
 'user commits',
 'log file sync',
 'redo size'
);

Also check wait time:

select event, total_waits, time_waited/100 time_sec
from v$system_event
where event = 'log file sync';

If log file sync time is high:
	•	Slow redo disk
	•	Slow LGWR
	•	Too many commits per second

This directly slows Replicat.

⸻

5. Check undo and rollback pressure

If undo is stressed, apply slows.

select begin_time,
       undoblks,
       txncount,
       maxquerylen
from v$undostat
order by begin_time desc fetch first 10 rows only;

Red flags:
	•	Very high TXNCOUNT
	•	Large MAXQUERYLEN
	•	Undo tablespace close to full

⸻

6. Check index overhead on target

GoldenGate applies row by row. Indexes hurt.

Find tables with excessive indexes:

select table_name, count(*) index_count
from dba_indexes
where owner = '<schema>'
group by table_name
having count(*) > 5
order by index_count desc;

Tables with many indexes slow Replicat badly during heavy apply.

⸻

7. Check for trigger overhead

Triggers execute for every replicated row.

select owner, table_name, trigger_name, status
from dba_triggers
where table_owner = '<schema>'
and status = 'ENABLED';

Enabled triggers on replicated tables are a classic Replicat killer.

⸻

8. Check segment and block contention

Hot tables or indexes.

select owner, object_name, object_type, statistic_name, value
from v$segment_statistics
where statistic_name in (
 'buffer busy waits',
 'row lock waits'
)
and value > 0
order by value desc;

If replicated tables appear here, DB contention is proven.

⸻

SELECT
    c.table_name,
    c.column_name,
    c.data_type,
    c.data_length,
    c.nullable,
    CASE
        WHEN uc.column_name IS NOT NULL THEN 'YES'
        ELSE 'NO'
    END AS unique_column
FROM user_tab_columns c
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        acc.table_name,
        acc.column_name
    FROM user_constraints ac
    JOIN user_cons_columns acc
        ON ac.constraint_name = acc.constraint_name
    WHERE ac.constraint_type = 'U'
) uc
    ON c.table_name = uc.table_name
   AND c.column_name = uc.column_name
ORDER BY c.table_name, c.column_id;


9. Check system resource pressure

GoldenGate apply is CPU and IO sensitive.

CPU throttling

select * from v$rsrcmgrmetric;

If you see resmgr:cpu quantum, Resource Manager is slowing Replicat.

IO latency

select file_name, average_read_time
from v$filestat fs join dba_data_files df
on fs.file# = df.file_id
order by average_read_time desc;


⸻

10. Correlate lag time with DB load

Match lag increase time with:
	•	AWR reports
	•	Batch jobs
	•	Index rebuilds
	•	Stats gathering
	•	Reports

GoldenGate lag rarely happens in isolation.

How to present this to GG / app team

You should say things like:
	•	“Replicat sessions are blocked by SID X on TX lock”
	•	“Replicat waiting on log file sync due to commit pressure”
	•	“Apply slowed due to enabled triggers and high index count”
	•	“Resource Manager is throttling Replicat CPU”

This shifts responsibility clearly.

⸻

If you want, paste:
	•	Output of Replicat session waits
	•	Blocking session query
	•	Top wait events during lag window

I will tell you exactly which DB factor is slowing replication.
