Oracle doesn’t provide a direct command to “backup and restore” a redaction policy, but you can manually export the policy definition as SQL, and later recreate it using PL/SQL. Here’s how to do it safely and effectively:

⸻

✅ Step 1: Backup redaction policy (generate SQL script)

You can manually extract policy definitions using this query:

SELECT 'BEGIN DBMS_REDACT.ADD_POLICY(' ||
       'object_schema => ''' || object_schema || ''', ' ||
       'object_name => ''' || object_name || ''', ' ||
       'policy_name => ''' || policy_name || ''', ' ||
       'column_name => ''' || column_name || ''', ' ||
       'function_type => ''' || function_type || ''', ' ||
       'expression => ''' || NVL(expression, '') || ''', ' ||
       'policy_description => ''' || NVL(policy_description, '') || '''); END; /'
AS create_policy_script
FROM   dba_redaction_columns
WHERE  object_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME'
AND    object_schema = 'YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME';

This will give you a script that looks like:

BEGIN 
  DBMS_REDACT.ADD_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'HR',
    object_name => 'CUSTOMERS',
    policy_name => 'REDACT_SSN',
    column_name => 'SSN',
    function_type => 'FULL',
    expression => '1=1',
    policy_description => 'Redact SSN data');
END;
/

🔁 You should store this output in a .sql file as a backup.

⸻

🧪 Optional: Backup multiple policies (if more than one column or condition)

Run this for more detailed backup including options:

SELECT *
FROM   dba_redaction_policies
WHERE  object_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME'
AND    object_owner = 'YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME';

SELECT *
FROM   dba_redaction_columns
WHERE  object_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME'
AND    object_owner = 'YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME';


⸻

🔁 Step 2: Restore redaction policy

Just run the backup SQL file or re-execute the DBMS_REDACT.ADD_POLICY block(s).

⸻

🛡️ Tip: Export to a file using SQL*Plus

If you’re using SQL*Plus or SQLcl:

SPOOL backup_redaction_policy.sql

-- Run the backup SQL query above

SPOOL OFF

This will save the output into backup_redaction_policy.sql.

⸻

🧼 Optional: Clean existing policies before restoring

If you’re restoring, you might want to drop any existing conflicting policies first:

BEGIN
  DBMS_REDACT.DROP_POLICY(
    object_schema => 'HR',
    object_name => 'CUSTOMERS',
    policy_name => 'REDACT_SSN');
END;
/


⸻

If you’d like, share your table name and schema (and optionally sample redacted columns), and I can generate the exact backup script for you.
