Got it. Hereâ€™s the revised draft with the details you mentioned:

Subject: Appreciation for Successful Rebuild of APSF and MACAS Databases

Dear Team,

I would like to take a moment to appreciate the outstanding efforts of our team for successfully completing the rebuild from scratch of the APSF and MACAS 2-node RAC databases, covering a total of 8 nodes. This critical activity was carried out to mitigate the identified VA points at the OS level and was executed without impacting ongoing bank business operations. The entire task was completed smoothly within the stipulated timelines, ensuring both compliance and system stability.

Your dedication, collaboration, and technical expertise were instrumental in achieving this milestone.

Special thanks to [Team Member 1], [Team Member 2], [Team Member 3], and [Your Name, if applicable] for their hard work and commitment throughout this activity.

Great job, team, and letâ€™s continue the same spirit in our upcoming projects.

Best regards,
[Your Managerâ€™s Name / Your Name]

Do you want me to also make a shorter version that your manager can circulate widely (for senior leadership visibility), in addition to this detailed one?


Perfect, Iâ€™ll prepare the same structured sheet for the commands from your screenshot. I wonâ€™t repeat the ones already covered earlier. Hereâ€™s the new RAC Precheck Sheet (continuation):

ðŸ‘‰ This extends your earlier precheck sheet with all the CRS, OPatch, Listener, and SCAN-related checks. Descriptions are short, technical, and precise so it looks like a professional DBA checklist.















Perfect ðŸ‘Œ I see your second screenshot. This one is focused on database-level prechecks (SQL queries, RMAN checks, ASM, Golden Image backup, etc.). Letâ€™s rewrite these into a professional table with informative descriptions, just like we did for the OS side.

Database Prechecks (DBA Side)

Sr	Description	Command
1	Verify database instances running on the server.	`ps -ef
2	Verify database names from Oracle password file.	cat $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapw<SID>
3	Generate SQL*Plus spool file for database environment details.	create pfile='/home/oracle/init<SID>_$(date +%d%m%Y)' from spfile;
4	Generate memory parameter file from current spfile.	create pfile='/home/oracle/init<SID>_$(date +%d%m%Y)' from memory;
5	Verify instance and database details including DB name, host, version, open mode, log mode, and database role.	SQL query against v$instance and v$database
6	Verify archive log configuration and status by thread.	select * from v$archived_log;
7	Verify SGA and PGA parameters including memory allocations.	select name,value from v$parameter where name in ('sga_max_size','sga_target','shared_pool_size','pga_aggregate_target','pga_aggregate_limit');
8	Verify datafile and tablespace details including size and auto-extend status.	select FILE_ID,TABLESPACE_NAME,FILE_NAME,BYTES/1024/1024/1024 GB,AUTOEXTENSIBLE from dba_data_files;
9	Verify redo log groups, members, and sizes.	select * from v$log;
10	Verify redo log membersâ€™ file details.	select * from v$logfile;
11	Verify standby redo log configuration.	select GROUP#,THREAD#,BYTES,STATUS from v$standby_log;
12	Verify control file information including file name and size.	select * from v$controlfile;
13	Verify database properties such as creation time and database name.	select FILE#,CREATION_TIME,TS#,NAME,BYTES/1024/1024/1024 GB from v$tablespace;
14	Verify invalid database objects for cleanup before upgrade/migration.	select owner,object_name,object_type,status from dba_objects where status='INVALID';
15	Verify important database initialization parameters.	show parameter spfile;
16	Verify RMAN backup configuration.	RMAN> show all;
17	Verify database spfile and parameter backup.	RMAN> backup spfile;
18	Verify database control file backup.	RMAN> backup current controlfile;
19	Verify database archivelog backup.	RMAN> backup archivelog all;
20	Perform Gold Image backup for cloning or reference build.	Custom RMAN / OS backup procedure
21	Backup Oracle Wallet folder (if TDE is used).	cp -r $ORACLE_BASE/admin/<DB_UNIQUE_NAME>/wallet <backup_location>
22	Backup Oracle Inventory before database reinstall or migration.	tar -cvf oraInventory_bkp.tar /u01/app/oraInventory
23	Backup critical scripts and configuration files (oratab, init files, ASM configs, etc.).	cp /etc/oratab /backup_location + scripts

âœ… Now you have:
	â€¢	OS Prechecks Table (from before)
	â€¢	DB Prechecks Table (this one)

Together, these give a comprehensive precheck package before formatting the server for your RAC setup.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to combine OS + DB prechecks into a single Excel sheet (two tabs) in the polished format so you can directly share with your senior officials?
