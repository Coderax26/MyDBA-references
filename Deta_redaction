First, a small correction.
What you are looking at is Oracle Data Redaction, not reduction.
Redaction means hiding sensitive data when it is queried, without changing the stored data.

Now I will explain it step by step, very simply, using your screenshot.

⸻

1. What is Oracle Data Redaction (in plain words)

Think of redaction like this:
	•	Data in table is stored fully in database
Example:
9876543210
	•	When a user runs a SELECT query, Oracle masks part of the value
Example user sees:
XXXXXX3210
	•	No UPDATE happens
	•	No data is lost
	•	Only SELECT output is masked

This is mainly used for:
	•	Mobile numbers
	•	PAN
	•	Account numbers
	•	Aadhaar
	•	Customer IDs

⸻

2. Big picture of what your script is doing

Your script has three parts:
	1.	Redact MOBILE_NO column
	2.	Create a new redaction policy for Customer ID / PAN-like data
	3.	Alter an existing redaction policy

All of this is done using:

DBMS_REDACT.ADD_POLICY
DBMS_REDACT.ALTER_POLICY


⸻

3. First block – Mobile number redaction

Code part (simplified)

DBMS_REDACT.ADD_POLICY (
  object_schema => 'CMSSBG',
  object_name   => 'DECI',
  policy_name   => 'REDACT_MOBNUM',
  column_name   => 'MOBILE_NO',
  function_type => DBMS_REDACT.REGEXP,
  expression    => '1=1',
  regexp_pattern => '(\d\d)(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)',
  regexp_replace_string => 'XXXXXX\3'
);

Step by step explanation

Step 1: Which table and column

object_schema => 'CMSSBG'
object_name   => 'DECI'
column_name   => 'MOBILE_NO'

Means:
	•	Schema: CMSSBG
	•	Table: DECI
	•	Column to hide: MOBILE_NO

⸻

Step 2: Policy name

policy_name => 'REDACT_MOBNUM'

Just a name.
Think of it like a label for this masking rule.

⸻

Step 3: When should redaction apply

expression => '1=1'

This means:
	•	Always apply redaction
	•	For all users
	•	For all rows

If later you want only non-admin users, you can change this.

⸻

Step 4: How masking is done (important part)

function_type => DBMS_REDACT.REGEXP

Means:
	•	Use regular expression to hide data

regexp_pattern => '(\d\d)(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)'

This splits the number into groups:
	•	Group 1: first 2 digits
	•	Group 2: next 4 digits
	•	Group 3: last 2 digits

Example mobile:

98 7654 32

regexp_replace_string => 'XXXXXX\3'

Means:
	•	Replace first 6 digits with X
	•	Keep last 2 digits

So:

Original: 98765432
Shown as: XXXXXX32

Actual data remains unchanged in table.

⸻

4. Second block – Creating redaction for Customer ID / PAN

What this block does

DBMS_REDACT.ADD_POLICY (
  object_name => 'CMS_UPLD_COREFILE_DOM_TEMP_VIR',
  policy_name => 'REDACT_CUST_ID_ACCNO',
  column_name => 'CUC_CUSTOMER_ID'
);

This creates a new redaction policy for:
	•	Table: CMS_UPLD_COREFILE_DOM_TEMP_VIR
	•	Column: CUC_CUSTOMER_ID

⸻

Special thing here

regexp_pattern => DBMS_REDACT.RE_PATTERN_CC_L6_T4
regexp_replace_string => DBMS_REDACT.RE_REDACT_CC_MIDDLE_DIGITS

Oracle gives predefined patterns for credit card or PAN style numbers.

Meaning:
	•	Keep first 6 digits
	•	Keep last 4 digits
	•	Mask middle digits

Example:

Original: 123456789012
Shown as: 123456XXXX12


⸻

5. Third block – Alter existing policy

This part:

DBMS_REDACT.ALTER_POLICY

Means:
	•	Policy already exists
	•	You are modifying it
	•	Adding or changing column redaction

Here you add redaction to:

column_name => 'CUC_PRIM_ACCNO'

So now the same policy masks:
	•	Customer ID
	•	Primary account number

⸻

6. How to check if redaction is working

Step 1: Query as normal user

SELECT MOBILE_NO FROM CMSSBG.DECI;

You will see:

XXXXXX32


⸻

Step 2: Check actual stored value

Login as schema owner or DBA:

SELECT MOBILE_NO FROM CMSSBG.DECI;

You will see:

98765432


⸻

Step 3: Check redaction policy

SELECT * FROM DBA_REDACTION_POLICIES;

SELECT * FROM DBA_REDACTION_COLUMNS;


⸻

7. Simple animation in words (mental animation)

Imagine this flow:

User runs SELECT
        ↓
Oracle checks: Any redaction policy?
        ↓
Yes → Apply regex masking
        ↓
Masked data sent to user
        ↓
Original data stays untouched

Think of it like a transparent black tape placed on screen, not on the paper.

⸻

8. Very important points to remember
	•	Redaction works only for SELECT
	•	INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE are not affected
	•	Backup contains original data
	•	Data is not encrypted
	•	DBA can bypass redaction if configured

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Explain REGEXP part with more examples
	•	Show difference between redaction and encryption
	•	Show how to apply redaction only for specific users
	•	Create a small test table and demo flow

Just tell me.
